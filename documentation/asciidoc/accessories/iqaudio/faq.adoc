== Frequent Questions

=== Saving alsamixer settings

Storing the alsamixer setting can be achieved by performing the following at the command line:

----
$ sudo alsactl store
----

It is possible to save the current state to a file, then reload that state at startup (very useful for the
Codec boards and use cases)

To save:

----
$ sudo alsactl store -f /home/pi/usecase.state
----

To restore a saved file:

----
$ sudo alsactl restore -f /home/pi/usecase.state
----

=== Using external USB devices

If you want to enable 1.2AMP USB support (to allow USB hard disks to power up when
accessory boards are in use) then you may also want to add the following line to your `/boot/config.txt`
file:

----
max_usb_current=1
----

Please ensure your Pi power supply is able to deliver ~2.5amp if you are powering via mini USB and
enable `max_usb_current`

=== MPD based audio with volume control

To allow MPD based audio software to control the audio boardâ€™s built in HARDWARE volume the file
`/etc/mpd.conf` may need to be changed to support the correct ALSA mixer name.

This can be achieved by ensuring the'Audio Output' section of /etc/mpd.conf has the 'mixer_control'
line. Below is an example for the Texas Instruments based IQaudio sound cards (DAC
PRO/DAC{plus}/DigiAMP{plus})

----
audio_output {
    type "alsa"
    name "ALSA Device"
    mixer_control "Digital"
}
----

=== Screw sizes and part numbers

Useful Data:

* PCB screws are all m2.5
* PCB standoffs (for CASE) are 5mm male / female
* PCB standoffs (for Pi to IQaudio products) are 9mm female / female
* PCB standoffs (for XLR to DAC PRO) are 8mm female / male
* PCB standoffs (for the official Raspberry Pi 7-inch display) are 5mm male / female*
* The rotary encoders we have used and tested are the ALPHA 3 pin Rotary Encoder
RE160F-40E3-20A-24P, the ALPS EC12E2430804 (RS: 729-5848), the Bourns ECW0JB24-AC0006L (RS: 263-2839)
* The Barrel connector used for powering the DigiAMP+ is 2.5mmID, 5.5mmOD, 11mm
* The DigiAMP{plus} is designed to operate with a 12v 3amp to 24v supply such as the XPPower
VEC65US19 or similar
* The DigiAMP{plus} uses CamdenBoss two part connectors. Those fitted to the PCB are:
CTBP9350/2AO
* The speaker terminal used on the Codec Zero will accept wires of between 14 ~ 26 AWG
(wire of max 1.6mm in diameter)
