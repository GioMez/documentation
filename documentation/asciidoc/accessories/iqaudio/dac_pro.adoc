=== DAC Pro

IQaudio DAC Pro is our highest-fidelity audio output HAT for all generations of Raspberry Pi from Raspberry Pi 1 Model B{plus} onwards.

* Texas Instruments PCM5242 DAC to deliver outstanding signal-to-noise ratio performance
* supports balanced/differential output in parallel to phono/RCA line level output
* Includes a dedicated headphone amplifier.

NOTE: The DAC Pro is a HAT compliant add-on accessory for the Raspberry Pi.

The DAC PRO users the Texas Instruments PCM5242 to deliver outstanding Signal to Noise Ration
and supports Balanced / Differential out in parallel to Phono / RCA line level output. It also includes a
dedicated headphone amplifier.

The DAC PRO can be connected to the Raspberry Pi A{plus}/B{plus}/RPi2/RPi3 or PRi4’s 40-pin header
without any additional soldering. The DAC PRO is powered by the Raspberry Pi.

Component selection and track layout have been in the forefront of our design to ensure noise
immunity and best possible audio playback with the DAC PRO.

The DAC PRO exposes two 3 pin headers (P7/P9) used by the optional XLR board to provide
Differential / Balanced output exposed by XLR sockets above the Raspberry Pi’s USB/Ethernet ports.

P1:: Analogue out (0..2VRMS), carries GPIO27, MUTE signal (headphone detect), Left and Right
Audio and Left and Right Ground.
P6:: Headphone socket signals (pin1: LEFT, 2:GROUND, 3: RIGHT, 4:GROUND, 5:DETECT)
P7/9:: Differential (0..4VRMS) output (P7:LEFT, P9: RIGHT)
P10:: Alternative 5v input, powering the Raspberry Pi in parallel
