== Configuration

All our latest full size audio boards include a pre-programmed EEPROM. This allows Raspberry Pi
OS to auto detect and auto configure itself allowing the IQaudio boards to be plug and play.

If you need to configure Raspberry Pi OS yourself, you can edit the boot configuration file (found at
`/boot/config.txt`) to manually add the appropriate device-tree overlay:

|===
| Board | *`/boot/config.txt`*

| DAC Pro | `dtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplus`
| DAC{plus} | `dtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplus`
| DigiAMP{plus} | `dtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplusdtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplus,unmute_amp` or `dtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplus,auto_mute_amp`
| Codec Zero | `dtoverlay=iqaudio-codec`

=== Disabling on-board audio

To make your IQaudio sound card the primary audio device in Raspberry Pi OS you will need to
disable the Raspberry Pi’s on-board audio card. This is done simply by commenting out the
`dtparam=audio=on`device tree parameter on your sd card’s `/boot/config.txt` file by placing a `# at the
start of the line, saving the file and rebooting your Pi.

``/boot/config.txt`` should have the following entry to disable the Pi’s on-board sound card.

----
#dtparam=audio=on
----

=== Headless software

Many of the software packages used with the Raspberry Pi simply turn the Pi into a “Headless” endpoint. That is to say that it doesn't need, or expect, a screen/display to be physically attached to the Raspberry Pi’s HDMI socket

So if there’s no screen how do you control it?

Well in some cases you don’t need to do anything with the Pi at all. Take the https://roonlabs.com/[RoonLabs] images, that
turns the Raspberry Pi into a Roon Certified end-point. The Pi is then controlled form the RoonLabs
PC/Mac application which connects to and plays music through the IQaudio sound card on your
Raspberry Pi. No screen needs to be attached to the Pi itself.

Other “headless” applications install a web server onto the Pi, so to control it you simply open a
browser window on your PC / Mac / Tablet or similar and interact with the Pi based application
through a web page. 

NOTE: Applications such as https://www.max2play.com/en/[Max2Play], https://moodeaudio.org/[MoodeAudio], https://volumio.com/en/[Volumio] and https://www.runeaudio.com/[RuneAudio] work.
this way.

NOTE: Most audio applications assume they are the only thing running on the Pi so most require a dedicated SD card. The
applications are normally distributed as a compressed `.img` file (likely a `.zip` or `.gz` file) and this `.img`
file will need to be written to the Pi’s SD card to allow the Pi to boot.

=== Attaching the HAT

The IQaudio range of sound cards attach to the Raspberry Pi’s 2x20 way pin header (GPIO header).
They are designed to be supported on the Pi using the supplied PCB standoffs and screws. In
general no soldering is required to the IQaudio boards for normal operation.

The IQaudio range of boards are normally supplied with the necessary mounting hardware (PCB
spacers and screws), these are for our latest low profile boards 4x 9mm PCB spacers and 8x M2.5
screws. If additional parts (such as 2piece speaker connectors) are required these are normally
provided too.

The PCB spacers should be screwed (finger tight only) to the Raspberry Pi before adding the IQaudio
board. The remaining screws are then screwed into the spacers from above.

=== Codec Zero Configuration

The IQaudio Codec Zero board uses the Dialog Semiconductor DA7212 codec. The DA7212 allows
the recording of audio from the board’s built in MEMS microphone, from stereo Phono sockets (AUX
IN), 2x mono external Electret microphones and playback through stereo Phono sockets (AUX OUT)
and mono speaker connector.

Each input and output device has its own “mixer” allowing the audio levels / volume to be adjusted
independently. Within the codec itself other mixers / switches exist to allow the output to be Mono’d
for single speaker output, signals may also be inverted and there is a 5 band Equaliser to adjust
certain frequency bands. These settings can be controlled through alsamixer interactively or
programatically.

It is important to note that the AUX IN and AUX OUT are both 1vRMS. It may be necessary to adjust
the AUX IN’s mixer to ensure the input signal doesn’t saturate the ADCs. (Analogue to Digital
Convertors). Similarly, the output mixers may been to be adjusted to get the best possible output.

There is a set of preconfigured scripts (loadable ALSA settings) available on GitHub. https://github.com/iqaudio/Pi-Codec.

These cover several use cases such as:
 
* Mono MEMS mic recording, mono speaker playback
* Mono MEMS mic recording, mono AUX OUT playback
* Stereo AUX IN recording, stereo AUX OUT playback
* Stereo MIC1/MIC2 recording, stereo AUX OUT playback

NOTE: THE CODEC BOARD’S DA7212 CHIP NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT IS INPUT AND WHAT IS
OUTPUT AT EACH POWER CYCLE FOR IT TO OPERATE SUCCESSFULLY. We suggest your
application does this at startup or you add a suitable configuration to the `/etc/rc.local` file. 

=== Muting and unmuting the DigiAMP{plus}

The DigiAMP{plus} MUTE state is toggled by GPIO22 on the Raspberry Pi. The latest IQaudio device tree
supports the unmute of the DigiAMP{plus} through additional parameters.

Firstly a "one-shot" unmute when kernel module loads.

----
dtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplus,unmute_amp
----

Unmute amp when ALSA device opened by a client. Mute, with 5 second delay
when ALSA device closed. (Re-opening the device within the 5 second close
window, will cancel mute.)

----
dtoverlay=iqaudio-dacplus,auto_mute_amp
----

If you do not want to control Mute state through device tree then you can also script your own
solution. 

The amp will startup MUTED `to unmute the amp.

----
$ sudo sh -c "echo 22 > /sys/class/gpio/export"
$ sudo sh -c "echo out >/sys/class/gpio/gpio22/direction"
$ sudo sh -c "echo 1 >/sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value"
----

to mute the amp once more.

----
$ sudo sh -c "echo 0 >/sys/class/gpio/gpio22/value"
----
