=== Codec Zero

IQaudio Codec Zero is a Raspberry Pi Zero-sized audio I/O HAT. It delivers bi-directional digital audio signals (I2S) between Raspberry Pi Zero and its onboard Dialog Semiconductor DA7212 codec. Codec Zero supports a range of input and output devices,

* High performance 24-bit audio codec
* Supports common audio sample rates between 8-96kHz
* Built in MEMS microphone (Mic2)
* Mono Electret microphone (Mic2 left)
* Automatic MEMS disabling on Mic2 insert detect
* Supports additional (no fit) Mono Electret microphone (Mic1 right)
* Stereo auxiliary input channel (AUX IN) - PHONO/RCA connectors
* Stereo auxiliary output channel (Headphone / AUX OUT) - 3.5mm Stereo jack
* Flexible analog and digital mixing paths
* DSP for ALC (Automatic Level Control)
* 5-band EQ (Equalisation)
* Mono line-out / mini speaker driver: 1.2W @ 5V, THD<10%, R=8Ω

NOTE: Codec Zero is a Raspberry Pi Zero sized board but it also includes the HAT EEPROM allowing for
auto configuration of the Linux environment if needed.

Codec Zero is a Raspberry Pi Zero sized board but it also includes the HAT EEPROM allowing for
auto configuration of the Linux environment if needed.

The Codec Zero delivers bi-directional digital audio signals (I2S) between the Raspberry Pi and
onboard Dialog Semiconductor DA7212. Supporting a range of input and output devices from built in
MEMS microphone, mono Electret microphone or mono speaker (1.2W / 8Ω).

It also has GREEN (GPIO23) and RED (GPIO24) LEDs, that can be used for status and a tactile
button (GPIO27) that can be used to start an event.

The Codec Zero makes a great starting point for a walkie talkie / intelligent doorbell, vintage radio
hack or Smart type speaker.

P1 and P2 will support external PHONO / RCA sockets if needed. P1: AUX IN, P2: AUX OUT.
